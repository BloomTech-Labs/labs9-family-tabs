# Family-Tabs

Family Tabs helps families to stay on top of events related to everything from recitals, to soccer games to doctorâ€™s appointments.  Parents can view events on one screen, mark off events that have passed and edit existing events.  Family accounts allow full integration with the ability for older children to add events in real time and on the go to the app.  Parents can edit events made by children and manage schedules with ease.
